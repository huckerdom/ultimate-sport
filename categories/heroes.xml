&lt;p&gt;This is the one big piece of advice we got from Kayleigh, during
dinner on Friday.  Kayleigh and Willis have left Mumbai after a busy
couple of months here, working extremely hard to teach us everything
they could, in the little time available.  Thanks a ton!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kayleigh asked us, as beginners to watch (videos of) a lot of players
and pick players that appeal to us the most as heroes to emulate.
Pick players with the plays that you find most beautiful, as heroes
and try to emulate that aspect of the game, each time you are
practicing and executing that play.  Pick players with a physique
that's not too different from yours.  Watch players flick and throw
backhands, pivot, layout, bust deep, mark, and pick the player that
you find the most beautiful and keep trying to emulate them, over and
over.  I think it's worth emulating players in the way they train,
they conduct themselves on and off the field, and the way they
interact with their teammates and opponents...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>heroes</category><category>role-models</category><category>inspiration</category><guid>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/heroes.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2013 14:08:46 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
