&lt;p&gt;If you want to be a top player, a top team, you have no other option
but to practice as hard, with as much commitment as you can.  There's
no two ways about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you are the only one in a practice session, it doesn't matter.
There are surely things, that you can work on your own upon.  Show up
and Practice hard!  Set yourself &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.indiaultimate.org/2013/09/it-doesnt-have-to-be-fun-to-be-fun/"&gt;goals&lt;/a&gt;,
and work towards them.  Make yourself a training routine.  Do whatever
it takes, to get better as an individual player, and as a team!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>practice</category><category>player</category><category>top</category><category>team</category><category>commitment</category><guid>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/just-show-up.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2013 02:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Good players -- A quote</title><link>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/good-players.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a lovely quote from the preface of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Zvgbmv7OinAC&amp;amp;pg=PR9&amp;amp;lpg=PR9"&gt;Ultimate - Techniques &amp;amp; Tactics&lt;/a&gt; by James

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Resolve yourself to becoming a good player. Good players chase down swill.
Good players clear out.  Good players cut when they're tired. Good players
remember the defense. Good players call for help when they need it. In
fact, "good" players are great players. Great teams also require great
teammates. Become a great teammate. Be ready to play on time. Critique but
don't criticize your teammates. Apologize for your mistakes. Take yourself
out of the game when you're tired. Eschew pride.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>good</category><category>how-to</category><category>improve</category><category>advice</category><category>tips</category><category>quote</category><category>player</category><guid>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/good-players.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2013 02:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
