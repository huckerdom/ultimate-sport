&lt;blockquote&gt;
Resolve yourself to becoming a good player. Good players chase down swill.
Good players clear out.  Good players cut when they're tired. Good players
remember the defense. Good players call for help when they need it. In
fact, "good" players are great players. Great teams also require great
teammates. Become a great teammate. Be ready to play on time. Critique but
don't criticize your teammates. Apologize for your mistakes. Take yourself
out of the game when you're tired. Eschew pride.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><category>good</category><category>players</category><category>how-to</category><category>improve</category><category>advice</category><category>tips</category><category>quote</category><guid>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/good-players.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2013 02:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
