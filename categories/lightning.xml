Ultimate players, lost their lives, struck by a lightning during a practice
session!  My deepest condolonces to their near and dear ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met Piyush at the Surat Ultimate Open and enjoyed playing against him.  We
marked each other on quite a few points, in the game that was my first game in
a tournament.  He played hard, and pushed his team harder!  I vividly remember
him commending me on running hard and catching well.  I later chatted with
him, and was quite impressed with the work he was doing and his dream to give
the kids a platform to get greater exposure, through the sport!  Silent Voice
will surely miss him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piyush, may your soul rest in peace! :'(&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>rip</category><category>death</category><category>memory</category><category>lightning</category><category>surat</category><guid>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/rip-piyush.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2013 16:26:26 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
