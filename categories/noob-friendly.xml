Ultimate.  I've, thankfully, been introduced to Ultimate through a
bunch of friends, and playing it.  Then I came into contact with a
wonderful team, who were extremely patient with me...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what to talk about, at the barcamp.  I want to do justice to
these folks, and not ruin the game for them!  Any ideas on how to go
about, would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>beginners</category><category>talk</category><category>introduce</category><category>spirit</category><category>joy</category><category>noob-friendly</category><guid>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/introducing-ultimate.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2013 02:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Spirit Infected</title><link>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/spirit-infected.html</link><dc:creator>voodoo</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been playing ultimate once in a while. Or atleast I thought I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single day watching the folks play at the Juhu beach in Mumbai
convinced me that I was as good as someone who never played
before. All I ever did was throw the disc without a technique,
catch it without a technique, run around without a strategy and
hoped to score. I have practiced with them just a couple of
times, played with them a couple of games and I can say that the
experience has been thrilling. I knew the basic rules of the game
and loved it from the moment I heard of it. But there was a joy
in watching people play in the manner in which they were. Clearly
trying to improve, with a lot of intensity and yet enjoying every
bit of it. Most of all it is the people I have met, that have me
excited about the prospect of playing this game. The way they are
accomodating to new comers is something which I have not
experienced earlier. I already knew Punch, who introduced me to
this wonderful group and has also been helping me fix my
throws. On my first day, Pixie helped me with the throws, Sheryl
encouraged me to wait after I got the disc and make better
throws, and Chirag introduced the vertical stack to me. Though I
got a theoretical hang of it, I messed up big time in the game. I
did not touch the disc for the entire period of play. It was
totally due to my badly timed cuts. On my second day, I met
Ganesh. He amazed me with his patience. There was whole bunch of
new comers that day and he patiently took us aside to help us. He
spent a lot his energy in trying to help us improve. This was an
absolutely wonderful experience. He was critical and encouraging
at the same time, pointing out the flaws in what we were doing
and helping us correct them. I learned more Ultimate in that one
hour with Ganesh than all my previous trysts with it. His
enthusiasm was infectious. I now look up to Ganesh and the other
folks. I want to practice more, improve myself, play better, get
fitter, play harder and hopefully imbibe a little of their
spirit. Maybe they just made me want to stick around in Mumbai
for a little longer than I had planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>noob-friendly</category><category>spirit</category><category>joy</category><guid>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/spirit-infected.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2013 13:10:44 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
