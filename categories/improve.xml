Yay! I've really had
enough of off-season for this season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This season, every game, I'm going to go with one thing that I want to work on
for each of offense and defense.  I'm going to stick with it, for as long as I
need to.  Until, I'm satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defense: Mark better.  Move my feet more than what I do.  Be on the move,
while on the mark, rather than stand and lean over.  I'll keep posting on
things I discover, and try to make it "measurable".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offense: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ultimaterob.com/2013/08/22/just-catch/"&gt;"Just catch!"&lt;/a&gt;.
I'm going to get more natural while catching, and not get very conscious about
the mechanics.  I think the mechanics need to be fixed during practice, but in
the game, I need to just catch!  Focus on attacking the disc, and getting it
before your opponent or before it hits the ground.  Simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a good season, folks!  Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>practice</category><category>improve</category><category>game</category><category>goals</category><guid>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/targetted-sessions.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2013 18:29:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Good players -- A quote</title><link>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/good-players.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a lovely quote from the preface of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Zvgbmv7OinAC&amp;amp;pg=PR9&amp;amp;lpg=PR9"&gt;Ultimate - Techniques &amp;amp; Tactics&lt;/a&gt; by James

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Resolve yourself to becoming a good player. Good players chase down swill.
Good players clear out.  Good players cut when they're tired. Good players
remember the defense. Good players call for help when they need it. In
fact, "good" players are great players. Great teams also require great
teammates. Become a great teammate. Be ready to play on time. Critique but
don't criticize your teammates. Apologize for your mistakes. Take yourself
out of the game when you're tired. Eschew pride.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>good</category><category>how-to</category><category>improve</category><category>advice</category><category>tips</category><category>quote</category><category>player</category><guid>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/good-players.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2013 02:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
