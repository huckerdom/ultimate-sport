Yay! I've really had
enough of off-season for this season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This season, every game, I'm going to go with one thing that I want to work on
for each of offense and defense.  I'm going to stick with it, for as long as I
need to.  Until, I'm satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defense: Mark better.  Move my feet more than what I do.  Be on the move,
while on the mark, rather than stand and lean over.  I'll keep posting on
things I discover, and try to make it "measurable".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offense: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ultimaterob.com/2013/08/22/just-catch/"&gt;"Just catch!"&lt;/a&gt;.
I'm going to get more natural while catching, and not get very conscious about
the mechanics.  I think the mechanics need to be fixed during practice, but in
the game, I need to just catch!  Focus on attacking the disc, and getting it
before your opponent or before it hits the ground.  Simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a good season, folks!  Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>practice</category><category>improve</category><category>game</category><category>goals</category><guid>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/targetted-sessions.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2013 18:29:59 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
