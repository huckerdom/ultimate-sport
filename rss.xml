the senior players on your team, but here we go, anyway: There are
only two speeds for cutters in Ultimate, zero and full-speed.  This
may be a little bit of an exception, but most players who have played
for a few months would already realize that handlers don't give you a
disk, if you are not cutting at your full speed!  But, the speed rule
doesn't hold true only when you are cutting.  It holds when you are
clearing too!  You need to be clearing as hard as you cut, and still
"remain active" when you are clearing.  By active, I mean that you
should still be expecting a pass from the handler, and be ready to
catch anything that your handlers sends at you.  Even if that's not
the case, you should atleast make your defender believe that you are
active.  Otherwise, he/she can poach on you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often use the "extent" to which my defender is poaching on me, as an
indicator of how active I am on the field.  If I'm letting my defender
poach on me and get discs going to other players on my team, I'm
definitely not being active enough.  This can be used as an indicator
not just when I'm standing in the (vert/ho) stack and waiting, but
also when I'm clearing.  When clearing, you should ideally be looking
at your handler atleast from the corner of your eye, and keep looking
for opportunities of asking for a pass, the moment your defender
slackens a little upon you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/clearing-out-properly.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2013 02:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Rule of the Week: Spirit of the Game</title><link>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/rule-of-the-week-spirit-of-the-game.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to post one rule a week, starting this week, and this should
ensure at least one post a week up to Feb, '14!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also going to post the official interpretations of the rules, from
the WFDF interpretation guide that complements the rule book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WFDF interpretation guide also mentions the general principles on
which the rules of Ultimate are based.  It would definitely help
players to be aware of these principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="general-principles-for-the-rules-of-ultimate-from-wfdf-interpretations"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;General Principles for the Rules of Ultimate (from WFDF interpretations)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rules of Ultimate are based on principles that outline how the
game should be played and how to resolve issues. When encountering a
scenario that is not expressly described by the rules, these
principles are a good guide to help resolve the issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is trusted that no player will intentionally violate the rules;
thus there are no harsh penalties for breaches, but rather a method
for resuming play in a manner which simulates what would most likely
have occurred had there been no breach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A team should not be disadvantaged because the opposition has made
an error or caused a breach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calls should only be made where a breach has occurred that has a
meaningful impact on the game. Players should allow for a reasonable
degree of tolerance for minor breaches involving small discrepancies
in distance and time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not everybody sees a situation in the same light. Two players with a
very good view of a situation can still see very different things
happening. Human perception is not perfect. Players should be aware
of this when trying to resolve calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a call cannot be resolved then the disc shall be returned to
where possession was last undisputed and play shall resume as it was
prior to the call.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rule-1-spirit-of-the-game"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rule #1: Spirit of the Game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ultimate is a non-contact, self-refereed sport. All players are
responsible for administering and adhering to the rules. Ultimate
relies upon a Spirit of the Game that places the responsibility for
fair play on every player.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is trusted that no player will intentionally break the rules;
thus there are no harsh penalties for breaches, but rather a method
for resuming play in a manner which simulates what would most
likely have occurred had there been no breach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players should be mindful of the fact that they are acting as
referees in any arbitration between teams. Players must:&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;know the rules;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be fair-minded and objective;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be truthful;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;explain their viewpoint clearly and briefly;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allow opponents a reasonable chance to speak;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;resolve disputes as quickly as possible, using respectful
language;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make calls in a consistent manner throughout the game;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only make a call where a breach is significant enough to make a
difference to the outcome of the action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly competitive play is encouraged, but should never sacrifice
the mutual respect between players, adherence to the agreed-upon
rules of the game, or the basic joy of play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following actions are examples of good spirit:&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;informing a team-mate if they have made a wrong or unnecessary
call or caused a foul or violation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;retracting a call when you no longer believe the call was
necessary;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;complimenting an opponent for good play or spirit;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;introducing yourself to your opponent; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reacting calmly towards disagreement or provocation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following actions are clear violations of the spirit of the
game and must be avoided by all participants:&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dangerous play and aggressive behaviour;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intentional fouling or other intentional rule violations;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;taunting or intimidating opposing players;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disrespectful celebration after scoring;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making calls in retaliation to an opponentâ€™s call; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;calling for a pass from an opposition player.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teams are guardians of the Spirit of the Game, and must:&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take responsibility for teaching their players the rules and
good spirit;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discipline players who display poor spirit; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide constructive feedback to other teams about how to
improve their adherence to the Spirit of the Game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case where a novice player commits an infraction out of
ignorance of the rules, experienced players are obliged to explain
the infraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An experienced player, who offers advice on rules and guides
on-field arbitration, may supervise games involving beginners or
younger players.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rules should be interpreted by the players directly involved in the
play, or by players who had the best perspective on the
play. Non-players, apart from the captain, should refrain from
getting involved. However players may seek the perspective of
non-players to clarify the rules, and to assist players to make the
appropriate call for "down" calls and line calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players and captains are solely responsible for making all calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If, after discussion, players cannot agree what occurred in a play,
the disc shall be returned to the last non-disputed thrower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="interpretations"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interpretations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Providing evidence to support a call (1.3.4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;What&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first last"&gt;It is an essential component of good spirit that a player must
be prepared, if asked, to explain concisely the objective
evidence that led to making a call, or contesting a call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Example&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first last"&gt;After making a travel call, if asked, the defender might explain
"I saw you lift your pivot foot while the disc was still in your
hand."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Why&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;The objective evidence is evidence that can be tested for
validity. It makes it clear that the call was not based on
emotion or what the player wanted or expected to happen, but what
they actually observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;If a player is not reasonably certain of the objective evidence,
they should not make a call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Extra&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first last"&gt;Players should be aware and understanding of the language
limitations accompanying international play, however opponents
should still be able to communicate, even through gestures, what
they saw. Team captains and team mates should get involved if
they think their teamâ€™s player is wrong or does not behave
correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Making calls in a consistent manner throughout the game (1.3.7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;What&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first last"&gt;Players should make calls without taking into account the
context of the game. This means that players should not start
making more calls just because the game is nearly over and the
scores are quite close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Example&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first last"&gt;If at the start of the game minor travel infractions were not
called, then they should not be called later in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Only calling significant breaches (1.3.8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;What&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first last"&gt;Players should allow for a reasonable degree of tolerance for
minor breaches involving small discrepancies in distance and
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Example&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first last"&gt;If the thrower established a pivot one centimetre away from the
correct pivot point then a travel infraction should not be called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Disrespectful celebration after scoring (1.6.4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;What&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first last"&gt;This includes spiking directed at an opponent and taunting of the
opponent by "showing" them the disc. These actions must be
avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Result&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first last"&gt;Opposing team captains should discuss all matters relating to
violations of spirit and try to resolve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Seeking perspective from non players (1.10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Note&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;It is still up to the players involved to make the final
call. Non players must not provide verbal advice regarding a call
unless they are requested to by the players involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Line calls are defined as any call relating to the spot that the
disc became or went out-of-bounds, or a player's position
relative to the perimeter lines or goal line. Line calls relate
to the following calls: "out-of-bounds", "goal" and "offside".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Discussion of what occurred in a play (1.12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Note&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Before the disc is returned to the thrower when players cannot
agree, players should discuss what happened in the play. Both
players involved should attempt to clearly explain what they
think happened and listen to the view of their opponent, or other
players with good perspective on the play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If discussion is difficult due to a language barrier, then
gestures or recreations of the incident can be used to indicate
what was experienced during the incident (eg. striking yourself
across the back of the hand to show that your hand was hit as you
were trying to catch the disc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;The discussion should be as brief as possible with the preferred
outcome being either a retracted call, or an uncontested
call. However once it becomes clear that no resolution will be
reached, the disc should be returned to the last non- disputed
thrower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="spirit-of-the-game-stoppage-appendix-9"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spirit of the Game Stoppage (Appendix 9)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a team's captain believes that either or both teams are failing
to follow the Spirit of the Game (SOTG), they may call a "Spirit of
the Game Stoppage". This can only be called:&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a call which stops the play or any other stoppage, prior
to the disc being checked in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the start of a point and prior to the ensuing pull.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During this stoppage, neither team may engage in tactical
discussions. All team members of both teams will form a "spirit
circle" in the middle of the field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separately from the spirit circle, the two opposing team captains
shall discuss all current issues with adherence to SOTG, determine
actions to rectify those issues, and then convey the agreement to
the spirit circle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SOTG stoppages do not affect, nor are they affected by, the number
of time-outs available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time taken for a SOTG Stoppage will be added to the game time to
determine time caps for the game. The captain initiating the
Stoppage will convey the start and end of the Stoppage to game
officials for time-keeping purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

For the second time in 2013,
Fountainhead School is going to host a tournament.  Delhi and Surat
swapped spots on the calendar, due to some issues with organizing the
Delhi tournament in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last tournament in March 2013 was super fun, with good
accommodation and awesome food arranged by the school, along with
amazing fields to play on and lots of teams!  Look at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/213979788772971/"&gt;this facebook

The reasons why I play Ultimate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the Huck.  Ultimate FrisbeeÂ® 101, for anyone who has ever thrown
a FrisbeeÂ® or a Flying Disc.  I gave a talk today at Barcamp titled
&lt;em&gt;"What The Huck"&lt;/em&gt;, which was intended to be an introduction to Ultimate,
one that would hopefully get more people to play the sport.  But,
unfortunately, I guess I chose the wrong title for the topic, and not
too many people turned up for the talk.  So, I decided to post the
gist of my talk here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who do not know, what Ultimate FrisbeeÂ® is, here is a nice
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTHzkWoB6A"&gt;one minute summary of the rules of the game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long ago, a couple of friends shared with me a kind of a mantra that
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivian_Richards"&gt;Vivian Richards&lt;/a&gt;
shared in an interview: &lt;em&gt;Honesty, Intensity and Joy&lt;/em&gt;.  We just loved
this mantra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another time and age, the same couple of friends, introduced me to
the sport that I love, called &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)"&gt;Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;. (A shout out to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/cloud9trt"&gt;@cloud9trt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/avudem"&gt;@avudem&lt;/a&gt; for that!  Thanks folks!) This game
was fun, from the word go, but as I played it more and more, I fell in
love with this game.  As an after thought, I think one of the reasons
I love this game, is because it imbibes all the three values that Viv
mentioned: Honesty, Intensity and Joy.  Or actually, just for these
three things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="honesty"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Honesty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I play Ultimate, for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ultimatesport.in/posts/spiritn-spirit-the-keystone-of-ultimate.html"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;
it involves.  &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wfdf.org/sports/rules-of-play/doc_download/20-rules-of-ultimate"&gt;The rule #1&lt;/a&gt;
of the game is the spirit of the game, and the whole game relies on
the fact that the game be played in it's spirit.  Unlike most other
sports, Ultimate is self-refereed at the highest levels of the game.
It places the responsibility of fair play on every player, trusting
that no player would intentionally break the rules.  Essentially, the
game treats us as adults!  And that leads to a lot more intensity, and
a lot more fun in the games!  Games in tournaments (in India), end
with teams getting together in a spirit circle, where both the teams
circle up, and discuss, praise and criticize each others' games,
giving each other constructive and critical feedback.  You can play as
intense a game as you want, and at the end of it, finish off with an
equally important and intense, but stupid &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ultipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_games"&gt;spirit games&lt;/a&gt; and go home with no
hard feelings towards any of your opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="intensity"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intensity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9S0l-gQLQs"&gt;intense&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyOjtn9SxP4"&gt;Very intense&lt;/a&gt;.  Very
unlike the popular idea of throwing a disc in a park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This intensity is a sort of a healer, for me.  Taking you into a
different sort of a world, away from the craziness of every day life.
Each time you get on the field, you want to give your best, for
yourself, and for your team.  Anyway, if you don't, you opponents
would kick your ass.  And that definitely doesn't feel good. ;^)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="joy"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Joy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I play for pure joy.  The sight of a disc floating in front of me, is
so luring for me that I MUST chase it down and catch it.  The sight of
players, even from your oppositions, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=703778059638034&amp;amp;set=a.703168979698942.1073741838.633734823309025&amp;amp;type=3&amp;amp;theater"&gt;jumping sky high to come down
with the disc is such a joy&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimate involves a huge range of "tasks" - marking, defending,
catching, throwing.  Each of these tasks need quite a lot of practice
to get good at.  Learning a new skill is always a joy, whether it is
learning to throw a forehand flick or a hammer, or it is to learn how
the zone defense works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, what I found out today is that it's quite difficult to
talk about a game you love, and get across it's awesomeness. Some
things can only be experienced first hand!  See you on the field!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: A &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ultipedia.org/wiki/Huck"&gt;Huck&lt;/a&gt; is a long distance
pass - typically half the playing field or more. Hucks are a big part
of many offensive strategies as they often result in quick points or
substantial yardage gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to be a top player, a top team, you have no other option
but to practice as hard, with as much commitment as you can.  There's
no two ways about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you are the only one in a practice session, it doesn't matter.
There are surely things, that you can work on your own upon.  Show up
and Practice hard!  Set yourself &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.indiaultimate.org/2013/09/it-doesnt-have-to-be-fun-to-be-fun/"&gt;goals&lt;/a&gt;,
and work towards them.  Make yourself a training routine.  Do whatever
it takes, to get better as an individual player, and as a team!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>practice</category><category>player</category><category>top</category><category>team</category><category>commitment</category><guid>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/just-show-up.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2013 02:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Introducing Ultimate</title><link>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/introducing-ultimate.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.barcampmumbai.org/index.php/BCM12#Sessions"&gt;barcamp&lt;/a&gt; next weekend, that I want to talk at, about
Ultimate.  I've, thankfully, been introduced to Ultimate through a
bunch of friends, and playing it.  Then I came into contact with a
wonderful team, who were extremely patient with me...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what to talk about, at the barcamp.  I want to do justice to
these folks, and not ruin the game for them!  Any ideas on how to go
about, would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>beginners</category><category>talk</category><category>introduce</category><category>spirit</category><category>joy</category><category>noob-friendly</category><guid>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/introducing-ultimate.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2013 02:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Zen Throwing Routine</title><link>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/zen-throwing-routine.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another video, by Ultimate Rob, showing the Zen throwing routine

noticeably rusty -- running slower, not able to get to the right place
at the right time, rusty throws, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you don't get a chance to play Ultimate,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build strength; at the very least, keep fit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about Ultimate, talk it, watch it, read it, visualize it, ...
Just thinking about the game, I &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;, helps...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>off-season</category><category>commitment</category><category>rant</category><category>ultimate</category><guid>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/off-season-commitment.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2013 02:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Updates to the site</title><link>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/updates-to-the-site.html</link><dc:creator>punchagan</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not really a post on Ultimate, but just a note on some of the
changes I made to the site.  I've spent quite a bit of time on the new
theme, and I like the way it has turned out.  I know, some of you are
thinking, I could've gone to the field and got in some throws instead!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can skip the rest of the post, if you are not interested in the
details of how the site is published and the theme.  But, for the
interested, here are the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site is powered by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://getnikola.com"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt;, a static site
generator, written in Python.  The posts are written in plain text
using &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html"&gt;reStructured text&lt;/a&gt;.
Anybody can contribute to the site, either by forking the repository
on GitHub and sending us a pull request, or just leave a comment on
this post, and we'll get back to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/huckerdom/nyck"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It is a mix
of twitter's look and the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/punchagan/lagom4ni"&gt;Lagom4ni&lt;/a&gt; theme.  The theme changes
the background image automatically, by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/huckerdom/ultimate-sport/blob/master/plugins/themes.py#L100"&gt;fetching a random image&lt;/a&gt;
from Flickr.  Also, the image is analyzed to find the dominant color
of the image and style the rest of the looks of the site.  The bottom
of the page, contains a link to the original image on Flickr.  I'm not
responsible for any images that look inappropriate. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I've also designed a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/huckerdom/huckimg/blob/master/ultimate-sport-512.png"&gt;new logo&lt;/a&gt;
for the site.  It is a shameless ripoff of the "I &amp;lt;3 NY" theme.  The
skying image is a derivative of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/damclean/260337381/"&gt;this photograph&lt;/a&gt;.  Any suggestions
to improve the logo are welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/kkrovvidi"&gt;@kkrovvidi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/baali_"&gt;@baali_&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/cloud9trt"&gt;@cloud9trt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/riteshsaini"&gt;@riteshsaini&lt;/a&gt; and everyone else, who helped with
the logo and the theme design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I wish to update the post regularly.  I've even managed to get a
new &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ralsina/nikola/pull/602"&gt;scheduling feature&lt;/a&gt;
added to Nikola, for this!  I &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/huckerdom/ultimate-sport/blob/f37ef6fb8e34541c2086b417fc4390b7a4d3cc33/conf.py#L323"&gt;plan to update&lt;/a&gt;
the site every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 8 am.  I wouldn't mind
a poke or two, from the readers, if I go out of schedule!  Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>site</category><category>logo</category><category>design</category><category>updates</category><guid>http://blog.ultimatesport.in/posts/updates-to-the-site.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2013 02:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
