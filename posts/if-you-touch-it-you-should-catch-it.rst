Yesterday's game: Light vs. Dark.  Score-line: 2-11 & 2-4.  A very
lopsided game.  For the record, I was in the light/white team.  What
went wrong?  A lot of things, we were getting a lot of our basics
wrong and the opposition was capitalizing on every small mistake we
made.  We were getting broken, left, right and center; Getting beaten
on the open side; and worst of all dropping simple catches -- unforced
turnovers!  I'm guilty of a couple.

I think the opposition was running hard in D and putting a lot of
pressure on us, but most of the catches that were dropped, seemed to
me like the players were thinking of where they'll put the disc next,
even before they got the disc in their hands.  Like they say, you
should be watching the disc into your hands, while catching it.  Set
yourself, look around and put it, where you want to!


These are some of the things, I think would help avoid silly drops --

- Watch the disc into your hands, and catch it!
- Don't begin to think of your throw, before the catch.  Worse, don't
  let yourself think about the fight you had with your boyfriend on
  the previous night.
- Get comfortable with having the disc in your hands.
- Even if you are just a cutter, develop a reasonable arsenal of
  throws, so you feel more comfortable getting the disc into your
  hands and passing it onto the handler.
