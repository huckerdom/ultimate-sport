.. description: How do we clear out properly?
.. author: punchagan

Most of you playing Ultimate would've already heard this from one of
the senior players on your team, but here we go, anyway: There are
only two speeds for cutters in Ultimate, zero and full-speed.  This
may be a little bit of an exception, but most players who have played
for a few months would already realize that handlers don't give you a
disk, if you are not cutting at your full speed!  But, the speed rule
doesn't hold true only when you are cutting.  It holds when you are
clearing too!  You need to be clearing as hard as you cut, and still
"remain active" when you are clearing.  By active, I mean that you
should still be expecting a pass from the handler, and be ready to
catch anything that your handlers sends at you.  Even if that's not
the case, you should atleast make your defender believe that you are
active.  Otherwise, he/she can poach on you!

I often use the "extent" to which my defender is poaching on me, as an
indicator of how active I am on the field.  If I'm letting my defender
poach on me and get discs going to other players on my team, I'm
definitely not being active enough.  This can be used as an indicator
not just when I'm standing in the (vert/ho) stack and waiting, but
also when I'm clearing.  When clearing, you should ideally be looking
at your handler atleast from the corner of your eye, and keep looking
for opportunities of asking for a pass, the moment your defender
slackens a little upon you.
