#   Polish -> pl
#   Russian -> ru
#   Spanish -> es
#   Italian -> it

#
# If you want to use Nikola with a non-supported language you have to provide
# a module containing the necessary translations
# (p.e. look at the modules at: ./nikola/data/themes/default/messages/fr.py).
# If a specific post is not translated to a language, then the version
# in the default language will be shown instead.

# What is the default language?

# The format is {"translationcode" : "path/to/translation" }
# the path will be used as a prefix for the generated pages location

# The wildcard is used to generate a list of reSt source files

# That fragment must have an associated metadata file (whatever/thing.meta),
# and opcionally translated files (example for spanish, with code "es"):
#     whatever/thing.txt.es and whatever/thing.meta.es
#
# From those files, a set of HTML fragment files will be generated:
# cache/whatever/thing.html (and maybe cache/whatever/thing.html.es)

# These files are combinated with the template to produce rendered
# pages, which will be placed at

# where "pagename" is specified in the metadata file.

# if use_in_feed is True, then those posts will be added to the site's
